## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (Variables)
- Flexbox for centering and alignment
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

In this project, I focused on creating a "hard shadow" aesthetic using CSS. While I initially used pseudo-elements (`::after`), I learned how to manage layers and `z-index` to ensure the card appears correctly above its background elements.

I also practiced responsive design using Media Queries to adjust the card width and font sizes for larger screens:

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Refine my accessibility (A11y) skills by ensuring better use of heading levels and focus indicators.
- Experiment with more complex `box-shadow` properties to replace pseudo-element hacks for card shadows.
- Optimize image loading by using more modern formats or responsive image sets.
